  <h1>DO HARD THINGS</h1>
  <h2>THE ART OF DOING HARD THINGS</h2>
  <h3>BY S.K.I</h3>  

<p>
    Doing hard things requires perseverance. When a task seems daunting, break it down into smaller steps. Tackle just one small piece at a time instead of getting overwhelmed by the big picture. Celebrate small wins and milestones along the way to stay motivated.
</p>
<p>
    The path of least resistance is often not the best path. Although easy tasks provide short-term satisfaction, challenging ourselves leads to greater fulfillment. Lean into discomfort and remember the struggle is an opportunity for growth. The only way to improve is to push beyond our comfort zone.
</p>
<p>
    Patience and self-compassion are key. Progress and mastery do not happen overnight. There will be setbacks. Reframe failures as learning experiences, not judgments of self-worth. Be kind to yourself in the process. Stay positive and keep going.
</p>
<p>
    Hard things require commitment and grit. But the satisfaction of tenacity and purpose is far greater than fleeting pleasures. By engaging in difficulty, we expand our capacities. In the end, the struggle makes us stronger.
